Not in active development. Became small enough to use inline.

----

Include the JavaScript file at the top of your HTML file. The script parses
the current URL and reloads the page if the text after the "?" is "reload".

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<script type="text/javascript"
	src="https://deanturpin.github.io/reload/reload.js"></script>
```

### Reload flag
```
blah.com?reload
```
